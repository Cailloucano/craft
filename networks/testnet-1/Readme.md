# Testnet-1


Craft testnet-1 is an extremely simple test network designed to verify that:

* exp is non-transferrable
* craft is minted and distributed when exp is staked
* it is viable to work with cosmos sdk 0.46-alpha1 and tendermint v0.35.0
* NFTs "feel right"

Testnet-1 does not include significant feature development and is mainly about ensuring we haven't taken the wrong path before getting too heaviliy invested in the stack / versioning.
