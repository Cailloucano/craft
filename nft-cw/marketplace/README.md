# Marketplace Smart Contract

The marketplace smart contracts provide a generic platform used for selling and buying CW721 tokens with ucraft tokens. It maintains a list of all current offerings, including the seller's address, the token ID put up for sale, the list price of the token and the contract address the offerings originated from. This ensures maximum visibility on a per-sale instead of a per-contract basis, allowing users to browse through the list of offerings in one central place.
