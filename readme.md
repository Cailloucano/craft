# craft
**craft** is a DAO that operates minecraft server(s).


## How it work:

This chain is a DAO.

* Non transferrable staking token called `exp`
* Monetary token called craft for the purchase of in-game items
* Flutter mobile app for smooth signing


## Basic Dev Roadmap

* Testnet one makes sure that we got the vesting right and we didn't make a horrible mistake choosing SDK 0.46.0 and tm 0.35.1
* More feature development occurs while tn one is running.  We will use tn one to provide feedback and insights to the sdk team.  Both Seahorse and An1 are looking into these versions, too.
* When feature-complete (implmentation of mint-burn-redeem economy controlled by dao) there will be a second testnet
  * The second testnet will be used to look into the minecraft integrations and overall product quality
* Testnet3, is hopefully a brief affair that leads directly into mainnet, with a feature freeze starting at the launch of tn2.
